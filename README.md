## FEEDAR or RADEEF?

word by word searching for dhivehi radheef just an idea that flashed on me on mother language day 2024

TODO:

- [x] How to find the root word: (ge, men, remover?)
- [ ] connect to radheef.mv db too (some words are missing)
- [ ] Add google translate
- [x] Caching and redis setup
- [ ] get ready to deploy
- [ ] rename home to radeef (migrations..)
- [ ] PWA
- [ ] utilize google free limits as much as possible (Que words, track usage)
